Excel2LaTeX
===========

It's hard to make tables in LaTeX, especially if some columns are calculated. This Excel-To-LaTeX converter exports the current selection as a LaTeX file which can be included via the \input command in an existing LaTeX document. Nearly all formatting is supported (bold, italic, border lines, multicolumn cells, â€¦). Works with current versions of Excel including Excel 2010 and Excel Mac 11.

**I'm looking for a new maintainer for the project. I don't work on OS X on a regular basis, but there are several issues on this platform.**

This is currently only a placeholder; I'd be willing to migrate here from [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/excel2latex) where the code and issue tracker is currently hosted.
